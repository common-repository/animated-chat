The Animated Chat plugin allows your WordPress site to have its own animated chat room.

== Description ==

The Animated Chat plugin allows your WordPress site to have its own animated chat room.  Users create an animated avatar to represent themselves, then enter the chat room to send messages and interactions to other visitors.

== Installation ==

To install Animated Chat, you must first register your chat room at <a href="http://www.animatedchat.com/" target="_blank">Create your Animated Chat account</a>.  You can <a href="http://www.animatedchat.com/wordpressplugin.aspx" target="_blank">follow the instructions here</a>.

Animated Chat is installed and activated like any other plugin, however it is too wide to fit in a sidebar.  To fit the entire animated chat room on a page it is best to place it in a footer area, or on a page of its own.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will Animated Chat work on my iPhone or other iOS device? =

No, because the Flash player is required.  It works fine on desktops, laptops and Android devices which support Flash.

= Is it possible to create new avatar styles and avatar parts? =

Yes, however we have not released this ability to the broad public yet.  We expect to release this by March 30, 2012.  You can contact us at http://www.animatedchat.com if you're interested in beta testing with us.
